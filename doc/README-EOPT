== Monitoring EOPT ==

To prevent giving passwords by commandline, all monitoringplug checks can read
additional commandline args from a file. With --eopt you can enable and
controll this feature. By default the file /etc/nagios/monitoringplug.ini is
parsed and the section with the same name as the check is used. With a argument
to the --eopt option the file and section can be controlled.

  --eopt [section][@file]

With the followingcontent in monitoringplug.ini:
--------------------------
[check_name]
user=foo
password=bar
-------------------------
--eopt check_name@monitoringplug.ini injects "--user foo --password bar" into
the command arguments.
